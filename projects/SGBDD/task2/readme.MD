**RFM** is a method used for analyzing customer value. It is commonly used in database marketing and direct marketing and has received particular attention in retail and professional services industries.

RFM stands for the three dimensions:
1. **Recency** – How recently did the customer purchase?
2. **Frequency** – How often do they purchase?
3. **Monetary Value** – How much do they spend?

**Methodology**

`To get the RFM score of a customer, we need to first calculate the R, F and M scores on a scale from 1 (worst) to 5 (best).
`
1. **calculate Recency** = number of days since last purchase
2. **calculate Freqency** = number of purchases during the studied period (usually one year)
3. **calculate Monetary** = total amount of purchases made during the studied period
4. find **quintiles** for each of these dimensions
5. give a grade to **each dimension** depending in which quintiles it stands
6. combine **R, F and M scores** to get the **RFM score**
7. **map RF scores to segments**
