# Logistic Regression Spam Filter

Lets make a spam filter using logistic regression. We will classify messages to be either ham or spam. The dataset weâ€™ll use is the [SMSSpamCollection dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection). The dataset contains messages, which are either spam or ham.

## Spam Filter Code
We load the dataset using pandas. Then we split in a training and test set. We extract text features known as TF-IDF features, because we need to work with numeric vectors.

Then we create the logistic regression object and train it with the data. Finally we create a set of messages to make predictions.
